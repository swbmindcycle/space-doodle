## What you will build

This application builds the following AWS CDK stacks:

- WebStack
- SharedResourcesStack

### WebStack

This stack deploys an AWS Amplify application, with a CodeCommit repository that triggers an automatic build and CodePipeline. The Amplify App will be hosted at a dev subdomain. Please note that this domain is ephemeral, so if you destroy the application and rebuild the url will change.

This Stack utilizes the [`AmplifyDeploy` CDK construct](lib/constructs/construct-amplify-deploy/construct-amplify-deploy.ts) and integrates an AWS Cognito User Pool for authorization within the web application. Please note that to add new users you will need to retrieve the [AWS Amplify Domain and URL](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home?region=us-east-2#/) from the AWS Amplify section of the AWS Console. To add new users please follow the instructions for [creating Cognito user accounts as an administrator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/how-to-create-user-accounts.html).

### SharedResourcesStack

This stack deploys shared resources that are utilized across all stacks. This will currently include an AWS Cognito User Pool built from the [`CognitoAuth` CDK construct](lib/constructs/construct-cognito-auth/construct-cognito-auth.ts)

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
